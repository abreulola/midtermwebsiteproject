<h1>Welcome to DC Eats!</h1>
<img src="images.jpg" alt="Washington Header">  

<p1>Attending undergrad and graduate school in Washington DC has allowed me to embrace all the unique restaurants DC has to offer. Going out to new restaurants not only allows you to experience new food but also embrace different DC neighrborhoods. Eating out is a way to explore DC whether you are born and bread washingtonion or new to the district! </p1>
<h2>How to Navigate DC Eats!</h2>
<p2>Restaurant reviews will be categorized by neighrbohoods followed by a 5 star review system. There are a number of factors I take into consideration when performing a review. They include: the ambiance, the food, and the price point of the restaurant. </p2>
