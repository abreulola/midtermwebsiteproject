<h1>Welcome to DC Eats!</h1>
<p1>Attending undergrad and graduate school in Washington DC has allowed me to embrace all the unique restuarants DC has to offer. Going out to new restuarants not only allows you to experience new food but also embrace different DC neighrborhoods. Eating out is a way to explore DC whether you are born and bread washingtonion or new to the district! </p1>
<h2>How to Navigate DC Eats!</h2>
<p2>Restuarants reviews will be categorized by neighrbohoods followed by a 5 star review system. There are a number of factors I take into consideration when performing a review. They include: the ambiance of the restuarant, the food, and the price point. </p2>
