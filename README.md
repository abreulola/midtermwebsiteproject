<h1>Welcome to DC Eats!</h1>
<img src="images.jpg" alt="Washington Header">  

<p1>Attending undergrad and graduate school in Washington DC has allowed me to embrace all the unique restaurants DC has to offer. Going out to new restaurants not only allows you to experience new food but also embrace different DC neighrborhoods. Eating out is a way to explore DC whether you are born and bread washingtonion or new to the district! </p1>
<h2>How to Navigate DC Eats!</h2>
<p2>Restaurant reviews will be categorized by neighrbohoods followed by a 5 star review system. There are a number of factors I take into consideration when performing a review. They include: the ambiance, the food, and the price point of the restaurant. </p2>

<h3>Leopold's Cafe<h3> 
 
<p1> Ambiance:This european style like cafe is most likely a spot most visitors or locals miss. Its located in Cadey's Alley away from the chaos of mstreet. Customers are transported to what feels like a quaint restaurant in a small european town.</p1>
 
<p2> Food: When the DC weather begins to warm up, this is definitely one of my go to brunch options. Not only is the food great, but the brunch special drinks are great as well. My personal favorite menu items are the croque madame and the quiche!</p2>
 
<p2> Price Point: I think the brunch at Leopold's is a steal! Their dinner menu items are a little bit on the pricier side but that is how most georgetown restaurants are like.<p2>
 
<p2> Rating: Overall I give Leopold's Cafe 4 starts out of 5. The 1 point deduction is mainly due to their hit or miss service but the ambiance and the food is what really makes me a loyal customer!<p2>
