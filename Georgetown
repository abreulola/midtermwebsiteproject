<h1>Top 3 Hidden Gems in Georgetown!"<h1>
<h2>Leopold's Cafe<h2> 
<p> Ambiance:This european style like cafe is most likely a spot most visitors or locals miss. Its located in Cadey's Alley away from the chaos of mstreet. Customers are transported to what feels like a quaint restaurant in a small european town.</p>
<p> Food: When the DC weather begins to warm up, this is definitely one of my go to brunch options. Not only is the food great, but the brunch special drinks are great as well. My personal favorite menu items are the croque madame and the quiche!</p>
<p> Price Point: I think the brunch at Leopold's is a steal! Their dinner menu items are a little bit on the pricier side but that is how most georgetown restaurants are like.<p>
<p> Rating: Overall I give Leopold's Cafe 4 starts out of 5. The 1 point deduction is mainly due to their hit or miss service but the ambiance and the food is what really makes me a loyal customer!
